## Button for microcontroller

Library for handling button presses. This library should be suitable for different microcontrollers. For the implementation it is necessary to read the state of the button and the timer. 
Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to debug this library, so there may be errors in the implementation.
With this library you can handle single, double, triple and long presses.
## 
The button is read inside the library, in the button_check() function
